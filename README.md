# literally another slides making thingie

But using web components. Because web components are cool.

## Making your first presentation
1. Download the web components that make `literally` from `bower`:
```
bower install --save notwaldorf/literally
```
2. Create an `index.html` file that's a sibling to the newly created `bower_components` directory. If you want a different directory structure,
adjust the paths in the example as needed.
3. Add this to it:

```html
<html>
  <head>
  <!-- Include the polyfill, since web components aren't supported everywhere yet -->
  <script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js"></script>

  <!-- Import the elements -->
  <link rel="import" href="bower_components/literally/a-presentation.html">
  <link rel="import" href="bower_components/literally/a-slide.html">

  <!-- Optional: I also made you a basic theme that you can start with -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/literally/sample-theme.css">
  <style>
    /* The least you can do if you don't include the theme */
    body {
      margin: 0;
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }
  </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-presentation>
      <a-slide>
        <div class="title">slide one</div>
      </a-slide>

      <a-slide>
        <div class="title">slide two</div>
      </a-slide>

      <!-- a slide using the theme. There's also theme-blue -->
      <a-slide class="theme-orange">
        <div class="title">slide three</div>
      </a-slide>
    </a-presentation>
  </body>
</html>
```

That's actually it! You have a presentation!! All the arrows, space, enter and
clicks (on the left/right side of the slide) should advance/back up the slides.

## Details about the slide layout
If you don't care about slide layout, I tried to make things easier and
have `a-slide` make some design decisions.
If you don't like these decisions, you don't have to use them. You can just style whatever
content you're passing to the slide. The world is yours:
```html
<a-slide>
  <div class="...">
    <h1>...</h1>
    <h4>...</h4>
  </div>
</a-slide>
```

Now, back to styling.

`<a-slide>` has 3 sections of text, with the classes `pretitle`, `title` and `subtitle`.
You need to include these class names for `<a-slide>` to know where to position things,
but you can also use these classes separately for styling:

```html
<a-slide>
  <div class="pretitle">I am a thing before the title</div>
  <div class="title">I am a giant title!</div>
  <div class="subtitle">I am a subtitle</div>
</a-slide>
```

There's also some centering attributes that try to help:

```html
<!-- different horizontal centering -->
<a-slide align-center>...</a-slide>
<a-slide align-right>...</a-slide>
<a-slide align-left>...</a-slide>

<!-- the content will span the entire slide -->
<a-slide full-width>...</a-slide>
```

## How to contribute
If you're familiar with any Polymer elements, development is pretty similar
to that, using the Polymer [CLI](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli):

```
# make sure you have the polymer cli installed
# npm install -g polymer-cli

git clone https://github.com/notwaldorf/literally.git
cd literally
bower install
polymer serve
# navigate to http://localhost:8080/components/literally/demo/ to see the demo
```

## I think that's it!
üç∞ and üç∑ for all!
